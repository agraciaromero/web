<h1>PhD Summary Thesis - Dr Adrian Gracia Romero</h1>
<p align="justify">Supplying sufficient food to an increasing population is one of the most important challenges over the next century. To meet this demand, crop productivity will need to 
  increment while it is being threatened by <strong>climate change</strong> effects like the increase of temperatures and the intensity of drought periods. Improving crop 
  performance is key for an efficient adaptation to these challenging growing conditions, with crop breeding being one of the pillars. In that sense selecting more productive 
  varieties for specific environments requires a better understanding of plant acclimation to stress conditions, including efficient phenotyping approaches. Plant phenotyping 
  research pursues the development of new methods with high-throughput capacity and affordable to characterize non-destructively plant traits of interest. </p>
<p align="justify">The main focus of my doctoral thesis was to develop and study versatile and precise methodologies with the objective to seek high-throughput capacity while saving time and 
  costs in the phenotyping tasks of two of the most important cereal crops: maize and wheat. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), also known as drones, equipped with 
  imaging sensors (including RGB, multispectral and thermal) permits covering simultaneously hectares of experimental fields fast, precisely, and in a non-destructive way. 
  The performance of these methodologies to assess genotypic differences in grain yield was evaluated in maize and wheat, as the main crops worldwide, under different 
  agronomical and environmental growing conditions such as nutrient deficiency, conservation agriculture, drought and heat stress. We deepen into the relationship between 
  those remote sensing measurements and the physiological mechanisms involved in the adaptative response of the evaluated genotypes against a wide range of environmental 
  conditions. For that purpose, aerial measurements captured by the drone were calibrated with ground evaluations of crop biomass and leaf-clip sensors for the quantification 
  of photosynthetic pigments, and destructive samplings for laboratory analysis of nutrient metabolism and isotopic composition as a proxy of water status.</p>
<p align="justify">Main constraints for increasing yields in the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region are related to the loss of soil and its fertility particularly vulnerable due the low adaptive 
  capacity of their current cropping systems. Traditional practices of monoculture and soil tillage have led to a decline in soil fertility, causing the use of phosphorus and 
  nitrogen fertilizers to become essential, but this situation cannot be considered sustainable given the economic and environmental impact associated with high fertilization 
  rates. For that reason, studies performed in Zimbabwe were focused on the evaluation of genotypes under either low and normal phosphorus conditions or the application of 
  conservation agriculture together with different top-dressing nitrogen fertilization regimes, to overcome the nutrient poverty of soils. Maize studies were carried out in the 
  field of the Southern Africa regional station of CIMMYT (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center) located in Harare, Zimbabwe. In the first study corresponding to 
  chapter 1, the efficiency of the UAV phenotyping platform assessing genotypic differences in yield of a total of 26 maize hybrids under optimum and no phosphorus 
  fertilization at the seedling stage. Chapter 2 was focused in assessing a different set of maize hybrids at early growth stages under conventionally ploughed and zero-tillage 
  conservation agriculture conditions. Both studies conclude that vegetation indices related to parameters informing on the above-ground biomass assessed during early stages of 
  development performed well as grain yield indicators. Growing conditions significantly affected the initial vigor of the genotypes tested and those measurements were reports 
  as a good indicator of final yield. The results shown in Chapter 2 reported an accuracy decrease of the vegetation indices assessing yield under conservation agriculture 
  conditions in comparison to the conventional ploughing conditions due to difficulty in segregating what is biomass from the plants and what is the coverage. This limitation 
  results from the soil surface by the stover residues that helps to maintain soil moisture but adds noise to the remote sensing measures. The solution presented was to apply 
  of a vegetation mask using a NDVI threshold on the vegetation indices to avoid the soil background reflectance and then the performance assessing yield was improved. On the 
  other hand, in chapter 4 the performance of maize genotypes was evaluated under the combination of tillage and residue levels on maize grain yield and leaf nitrogen content 
  and measurements were performed at more advanced phenological stages closer to the grain filling. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of a set of single-leaf 
  and canopy-based remote sensing indices for assessing the influence of the top-dressing levels and the conservation agriculture practices. Results suggested that indices 
  informing about leaf and the canopy color were the traits that reported a better association with grain yield and N content in leaves. Concerning the canopy-scale 
  assessments, the height of maize at that phenological stage made difficult taking the images. An innovative option was presented by using a long “pheno-pole” with the 
  cameras attached.</p>
<p align="justify">In the case of Spain, projected changes in temperature and precipitation patterns in the coming decades are positioning the Mediterranean Basin as one of 
  the most prominent climate change hotspots, where severe impacts on agriculture are expected. Strategies to deal with those unfavorable future environmental scenarios require 
  the selection of crop varieties to increase their resilience and reduce risks of yield shortfalls. Wheat studies were located in different latitudes in Spain covering a range 
  of environments and grown under different management conditions, and sampling was performed during the reproductive stage of the crop (at heading, anthesis and grain filling) 
  and results were shown in two different manuscripts at chapter 3 regarding one year evaluation in Aranjuez (Madrid) and chapter 5 regarding three different locations, in 
  Aranjuez (Madrid), Coria del Rio (Sevilla) and Valladolid during three consecutive crop seasons. The combination of location, management conditions and year were considered 
  as different environments that provided a wide range of climatic conditions for the phenotypic expression of the genotypes tested. Measurements were performed at different 
  phenological stages during the reproductive part of the crop, since Mediterranean agro-environments are characterized by the occurrence of terminal (i.e. during the last 
  part of the crop cycle) stresses, such as drought and heat. In general terms, biomass indicators, such as canopy green biomass inferred from vegetation indices, together 
  with water status indicators, such as canopy temperature, were the most critical traits predicting GY. The delay of senescence in water-limited environments and the 
  photosynthetic efficiency measured by multispectral indices like the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) during anthesis were also relevant traits for GY under the rainfed 
  and late-planting trials, respectively.</p>
<p align="justify">Remote sensing approaches have become fundamental methodologies for agricultural monitoring and this thesis demonstrates the improvement in precision and 
  throughput of these techniques in phenotyping for growth monitoring, yield prediction, stress detection or nutrient deficiency diagnosis. As crop phenology varies due its 
  growth dynamics; likewise, the potential trait estimation of the different vegetation indices shifts in time. While in early stages indices might be driven mainly by 
  differences in early vigor, crop establishment and in general crop density; in more advanced phenological phases, when the canopies have a higher cover density, differences 
  in vegetation indices will respond to differences in crop status.</p>
<p align="justify">The use of multispectral sensors for the formulation of vegetation indices exhibited a high association with vegetation parameters such as above-ground 
  biomass, water and nutrient deficiency. Different vegetation indices were calculated, but most of the times the best indicator of plant status and the best yield prediction 
  was the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), based on the strong contrast between the near infrared and red regions of the spectrum by the plant canopy reflectance. 
  An important point of this thesis was to demonstrate that use of information derived from conventional digital RGB (of red, green, blue) images may represent a low-cost 
  alternative to the use of multispectral or hyperspectral information for formulating vegetation indices and results presented emphasize the capabilities of RGB vegetation 
  indices as phenotypic traits. The colour properties calculations of the canopy in high resolution images are valuable information of crop variability, even performing better 
  than the multispectral and thermal approximations. Finally, the assessment of canopy temperature was shown as a great promise for and indirect selection of maize and wheat 
  cultivars with optimized water status.</p>
<p align="justify">Results obtained in this thesis helped, in addition to calibrate aerial assessments with the ground evaluations, evaluate the benefits and disadvantages 
  of the UAV platforms. Ground and aerial measurements were taken at the same time on the same day in order to reduce the most the variation in the environmental factors such 
  as light intensity. Though, main differences are due to the resolution of the images: even using cameras with the same sensor size, the distance between the camera and the 
  crop canopy will affect the spatial resolution of the image. Incorporating imaging methodologies into aerial-based platforms permits to cover larger experimental areas in 
  less time, minimizing the temporal variation in environmental variables, like occurrence of clouds, while the effect platform distance to the target canopy on the image 
  resolution have a low impact on the measurements. Most clear benefits were reported in the canopy temperature assessments, which aerial measurements performed better 
  predicting GY than the ground evaluations. Apart from the throughput benefits, another important issue is that aerial photographs facilitate the coverage of the whole plot 
  and therefore overcoming canopy heterogeneity, while this is usually not possible for the images taken at ground level. However, in the case of tall crops such as maize, 
  ground evaluations might result difficult in advanced phenological stages, and when the adoption of drone technology can be limited by both lack of economic resources and 
  restrictive laws associated with the use of aerial vehicles. </p>
<p align="justify">Furthermore, we worked on the development of applications to facilitate the transfer of information captured from the UAV platform. For the processing of 
  this large amount of data we also present the MosaicTool software, for high-throughput data extraction and processing of UAV phenotyping data.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, unlocking the potential of the amounts of data collected from high throughput phenotyping programs is one of the major remaining challenges. Since 
  the main goals of most breeding programs focuses on increasing grain yield, most of the efforts for the extraction of useful information from the phenotyping assessments 
  relies on the development of algorithms of grain yield forecasting. Our results demonstrated how the use of machine learning approaches might be useful not only for 
  achieving accurate prediction models, but also helping in the data interpretation.</p>
<p align="justify">The development of field-based phenotyping technologies with the capability to non-destructively capture of plant traits and their incorporation into 
  aerial based platforms to improve high throughput capacities should become an integral and key component in the breeding pipeline. However, to correctly implement these 
  methodologies in phenotyping studies, it is important to determine which parameters to measure and the optimal phenological moments to measure them for obtaining the best 
  predictors of genotypic variability. The advances on phenotyping will help to develop accurate yield predictions models, fundamental to accelerate the selection process.</p>
